        Welcome to the my library of algorithms !
        Here you can find implementations of most
        fundamental algorithms and data structures.
        For each algorithm, you can find a brief
        description of it, as well Time and Memory Complexity.


        This library provides you with implementations of fundamental algorithms and data structures
        For each entity are presented Time and Memory complexity. 
        If there is no inside entity words Time and Memory
        then inside must be word Complexity - it's mean Time complexity
